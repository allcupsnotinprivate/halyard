"""Chain composition: pure fold of interceptors around a base call.

Ordering convention: **the first link in the list is the outermost one** -
it sees the call first and the result last. ``chain([a, b], base)`` runs
``a`` around ``b`` around ``base``.

The chain itself is stateless and built once. What *is* resolved on every
call is the scope: each link's state key is resolved through the axis
registry, and the instance for that key is fetched from the state store.
